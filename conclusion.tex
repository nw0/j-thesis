\section{Context and review}

This project drew together aspects of compiler transformations, differential equations and computation, computer architecture, and software engineering.
The different perspectives of the fields provided immense insight into the complexity of numerically approximating partial differential equations---a far cry from anything Taylor may have imagined in the 18th century!
These insights culminated in a transformation yielding significant performance gains in Devito's target domain: seismic imaging.
Though time-tiling is a well-established optimisation, this implementation is undoubtedly a step forward for Devito.

While the concept of time-tiling is straightforward, its implementation was decidedly not so: unlike interfacing with a `back-end' polyhedral compiler, such as CLooG or Pochoir (Section~\ref{sec:pochoir}) with all its attendant integration problems, implementation within Devito meant understanding the numerous stages of internal representation used to transform a differential equation into code.
Without these layers, Devito would not be able to expose APIs at different levels for more intricate applications; making a transformation that would work with these was a major hurdle.

The performance evaluation was enlightening and challenging in its own ways.
It is easy to be convinced of the benefits of time-tiling from the literature, and another experience altogether to witness real decreases in runtime while watching a wall clock;
mustering the scepticism required to confirm its validity required much deeper deeper reference to computer architecture and computation than implementing the transformation had needed.


\section{Contributions}
A summary of the contributions of this project.

\wip{Results change, proofread this late}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The main product of this project is the documentation and implementation of the time-tiling transformation in Devito, with its accompanying test cases and auto-tuner enhancements.

	\item We demonstrated a runtime decrease of 25\% with the transformation compared to the existing optimisations under real-world applications, including the acoustic wave equation stencil, of great importance to Devito's target domain, seismic imaging.

	\item \wip{Not yet} We propose additional optimisations which might bring Devito's performance closer to the theoretical maximum, based on others' research.

	\item \wip{This is easier} We presented a hypothesis on how the skewing factor affects the runtime of a stencil, which holds in our experimentation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Future work}

Implementation-related: retain in chapter: the problems and why not fixed, move: why/how to fix them -- a lot of detail is possible.

Non-implementation-related: further evaluation, particularly the skewing factor
