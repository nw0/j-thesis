\chapter{Space-tiling and the Devito compilation process}
\label{ch:devito}

We reviewed Devito's motivation and overall architecture in Section~\ref{sec:devito}.
% TODO: elaborate
This chapter examines the details of the existing Devito compilation process pertinent to our implementation of time-tiling, in particular the existing implementation of spatial-tiling (Section~\ref{sec:spatial-tiling}).

In general, we have assumed that Devito only performs valid transformations, which we verify against its extensive test suite.
Therefore, we are only concerned with the transformations that occur between skewing and tiling.


\section{The Devito symbolic engine (DSE)}
\label{sec:dse}

The Devito symbolic engine is responsible for stencil optimisation and common sub-expression elimination (CSE).
At this point the indices and loops have not been generated yet, but we have generated the stencil and know its data dependencies.

Although we are working with loop transformations, we will perform skewing (Section~\ref{sec:skewing}) in the DSE, as skewing is a modification to the canonical indexing scheme.

\subsection{Common sub-expression elimination (CSE)}
The purpose of CSE is to reduce redundant computation, by removing duplicate expressions~\cite{muchnick-acdi}.
Figure~\ref{lst:cse-valid} illustrates a situation in which CSE would be used.
In this situation, CSE would remove the two expressions, replacing it with one that subtracted \texttt{0.5F*u[time][x][y][z]}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{lstlisting}
float tcse0 = -1.0F*u[time][x][y][z] + ...
              + .5F*u[time][x][y][z];
\end{lstlisting}
	\caption{Code (from Devito) eligible for common sub-expression elimination. Formatting is my own.}
	\label{lst:cse-valid}
\end{figure}

In the DSE, this is also performed at a higher level.
There is a balance to be made here: time-invariant expressions are first separated and assigned to temporaries, avoiding needless CSE, thus decreasing code-generation time.

\subsection{Indexing}
Indexing in Devito is the transformation of a stencil equation with distance co-ordinates to an expression of an indexed data access.
It is a transformation between internal representations of the stencil.

% TODO: consider example

Despite being considered a loop transformation, we have chosen to perform skewing before any indexing occurs, for reasons which will be clear in the next chapter.
However, it is equally valid and perhaps more intuitive to skew after indexing.


\section{The Devito loop engine (DLE)}
\label{sec:dle}

The DLE performs loop transformations including loop fission and tiling, while also marking loops to be executed in parallel or that denormal numbers should be flushed.
Before it is invoked, the loops are built from the previously-manipulated expressions; clearly it would not be possible to implement tiling before this stage.

\subsection{Loop fission}
Loop fission splits a loop to improve data locality.
If the body of a loop nest contains code that can be split into otherwise independent parts, it may be a candidate for loop fission (Figure~\ref{lst:fission-valid}), especially the body can be computed in parallel.
By evaluating the loops one after another, the amount of cache available to each computation increases, resulting in a speedup.

% TODO
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{lstlisting}
Some code here... (wip)


It will be at least 4 lines
\end{lstlisting}
	\caption{A loop nest on which loop fission would be valid.}
	\label{lst:fission-valid}
\end{figure}

We can easily see that this does not affect space-tiling in Devito, as it has no impact on array indices, since the resultant loops appear in the same nest as the original loop, with the variables duplicated.
Likewise, this holds equally for time-tiling.

\subsection{OpenMP pragmas and parallelisation}
Another particularly relevant operation of the DLE is the addition of OpenMP pragmas indicating that a particular loop may be parallelised.

% TODO: example

While this transformation is performed after tiling, it is pertinent as loops must be marked as parallelisable in the intermediate representation.
Loop tiling generates new loops from old, usually resulting in loop nests that are twice as deep.
It is important to note which of the original loops can be parallelised, and consequently, which of the tiled loops can be parallelised.
This is not a major concern for spatial tiling, as seen in Section~\ref{sec:spatial-tiling}, but will later be important in time-tiling.


\section{Spatial tiling in Devito}
\label{sec:spatial-tiling}

Under the existing tiling transformation in Devito, tiling is performed over every spatial dimension.
Note that the innermost dimension may be vectorised instead.

With spatial tiling, dependencies do not cross tile boundaries, instead only referencing values computed in the previous time iteration.
Therefore, skewing is not required.

\subsection{Remainder loops}
When discussing loop tiling in Section~\ref{sec:bg-loop-tiling}, we constrained our tiles with \texttt{min} constraints.
To deal with the case when the tile size does not divide the extent of the iteration space, Devito instead implements \emph{remainder loops}, which Figures~\ref{fig:tiled-remainder-space} and~\ref{lst:remainder} illustrate.

\subsection{Determination of tile sizes}
One notes that the loop tiling method includes code to match tile sizes from a user-provided parameter and check their validity.
Nevertheless, this is not relevant to the discussion of time-tiling in this report, apart from the straightforward addition of another dimension.
Therefore, it is omitted from this section.
