	To my supervisors, Prof.~Paul Kelly and Dr.~Fabio Luporini, my deepest thanks are due for their invaluable advice and insight, for the clearest explanations which I can only hope to emulate, and for igniting my interest in computer architecture.
	I must also thank Sun Tianjiao, who provided much-needed early guidance on performance testing and regular advice throughout.
	These people made this project a delight to work on.

	Thanks also to my parents, for their boundless support. To them I owe this and my sense of determination. Finally, my unqualified gratitude goes to friends who remind me of the greater context of this---and every---work.
