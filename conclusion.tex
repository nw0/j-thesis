\wip{An introductory paragraph here (context):}

\wip{Results change, proofread this late}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The main product of this project is the documentation and implementation of the time-tiling transformation in Devito, with its accompanying test cases and auto-tuner enhancements.

	\item We demonstrated a runtime decrease of 25\% with the transformation compared to the existing optimisations under real-world applications, including the acoustic wave equation stencil, of great importance to Devito's target domain, seismic imaging.

	\item \wip{Not yet} We propose additional optimisations which might bring Devito's performance closer to the theoretical maximum, based on others' research.

	\item \wip{This is easier} We presented a hypothesis on how the skewing factor affects the runtime of a stencil, which holds in our experimentation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Future work}

Implementation-related: retain in chapter: the problems and why not fixed, move: why/how to fix them -- a lot of detail is possible.

Non-implementation-related: further evaluation, particularly the skewing factor
